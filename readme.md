# Heart Disease Prediction Application

This application predicts heart disease using a Flask backend and a frontend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Git installed on your machine

## Setting Up the Backend

1. **Clone the repository and move to the final branch:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sid1552/heartpredict
    cd heartpredict
    git checkout final
    ```

2. **Install the Python dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Flask application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The backend should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Setting Up the Frontend

1. **Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Install the npm dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the frontend application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The frontend should now be running, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use the application.
- The frontend will communicate with the backend Flask API to predict heart disease based on the input data.
